    "# Medical Diagnosis Expert System – Cardiology\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the behavior of an expert system developed for the medical specialty of **Cardiology**.  \n",
    "Using the `experta` library in Python, this system is capable of diagnosing 12 common heart conditions based on symptom patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each simulated case below triggers a different diagnosis, allowing us to test the system’s inference capabilities.\n",

    "| Disease                     | Description |\n",
    "|----------------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Hypertension**           | Chronic condition where the force of the blood against artery walls is too high. It often develops over many years and can lead to serious health problems, such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. |\n",
    "| **Heart Attack**           | Occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot, causing damage to the heart muscle. It's a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. |\n",
    "| **Arrhythmia**             | A problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat either too fast, too slow, or irregular. It can be harmless or life-threatening depending on the type and cause. |\n",
    "| **Heart Failure**          | A condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It can result from conditions that weaken or stiffen the heart, such as coronary artery disease or hypertension. |\n",
    "| **Coronary Artery Disease**| Caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. This reduces blood flow and increases the risk of heart attack and chest pain (angina). |\n",
    "| **Angina**                 | A symptom of coronary artery disease, angina is chest pain or discomfort due to reduced blood flow to the heart. It often feels like pressure or squeezing and can be triggered by physical exertion or stress. |\n",
    "| **Pericarditis**           | Inflammation of the pericardium, the thin sac-like membrane surrounding the heart. It can cause sharp chest pain and is often linked to infections, heart attacks, or autoimmune diseases. |\n",
    "| **Cardiomyopathy**         | A group of diseases that affect the heart muscle. It makes it harder for the heart to pump blood and can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest. |\n",
    "| **Aortic Stenosis**        | A narrowing of the aortic valve opening that restricts blood flow from the heart to the body. Symptoms include chest pain, fainting, and shortness of breath during exertion. |\n",
    "| **Endocarditis**           | An infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. It can be life threatening and usually occurs when bacteria or other germs from another part of the body spread through the bloodstream. |\n",
    "| **Mitral Valve Prolapse**  | A condition in which the valve between the heart’s left atrium and left ventricle doesn't close properly, sometimes causing blood to leak backward. It may cause palpitations, chest pain, or dizziness. |\n",
    "| **Congenital Heart Defect**| Structural problems with the heart present from birth. They can affect the walls, valves, or blood vessels of the heart and may require surgery or lifelong care. |\n",

    "|----------------------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Hypertension**           | Often asymptomatic; severe cases may cause headache, nausea, blurred vision, or nosebleeds. |\n",
    "| **Heart Attack**           | Chest pain, radiating pain, cold sweat, nausea, fatigue, shortness of breath. |\n",
    "| **Arrhythmia**             | Palpitations, dizziness, fainting, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath. |\n",
    "| **Heart Failure**          | Shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in legs/feet, irregular heartbeat. |\n",
    "| **Coronary Artery Disease**| Chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fatigue during exertion. |\n",
    "| **Angina**                 | Chest pressure, radiating pain, discomfort like indigestion. |\n",
    "| **Pericarditis**           | Sharp chest pain, fever, fatigue, worse pain when lying down. |\n",
    "| **Cardiomyopathy**         | Shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling, irregular heartbeat. |\n",
    "| **Aortic Stenosis**        | Chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath. |\n",
    "| **Endocarditis**           | Fever, chills, joint/muscle pain, fatigue, heart murmur. |\n",
    "| **Mitral Valve Prolapse**  | Palpitations, chest discomfort, fatigue, dizziness or fainting. |\n",
    "| **Congenital Heart Defect**| Shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling, heart murmur. |\n",
